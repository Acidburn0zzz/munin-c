What is this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a rewrite of commonly used plugins in C as a single binary. The
purpose is reducing resource usage:
 * disk space: the binary is smaler than the plugins together
 * more diskspace: it has no dependencies on other programs
 * less forks: it does not fork internally
 * faster startup: it doesn't start perl or shell
 * less memory: just a small C program
 * less file accesses: one binary for many plugins
This can be useful for machines with restricted resources like embedded
machines.

What plugins are included?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cpu entropy forks fw_packets interrupts load open_files open_inodes
processes swap uptime

How to use?
~~~~~~~~~~~
After compiling there will be binary munin-plugins-busybox. You can just
replace symlinks in /etc/munin/plugins/ with symlinks to this binary.
